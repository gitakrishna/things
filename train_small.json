Major examples of this can be found in Passive solar building design, greener roof designs, biodegradable materials, and more attention to a structure's energy usage. This major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment. Sustainability in architecture was pioneered by Frank Lloyd Wright, in the 1960s by Buckminster Fuller and in the 1970s by architects such as Ian McHarg and Sim Van der Ryn in the US and Brenda and Robert Vale in the UK and New Zealand. There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings which seek to meet green building sustainable design principles.

These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect."}, {"qas": [{"question": "How abundant is hydrogen on the earths surface?", "id": "56e1954fcd28a01900c679dd", "answers": [{"text": "third most abundant", "answer_start": 300}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "what produces hydrogen gas?", "id": "56e1954fcd28a01900c679df", "answers": [{"text": "bacteria and algae", "answer_start": 458}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Under ordinary conditions on Earth, elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas, H2.

Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade.

The Eriksonian framework rests upon a distinction among the psychological sense of continuity, known as the ego identity (sometimes identified simply as \"the self\"); the personal idiosyncrasies that separate one person from the next, known as the personal identity; and the collection of social roles that a person might play, known as either the social identity or the cultural identity. Erikson's work, in the psychodynamic tradition, aimed to investigate the process of identity formation across a lifespan. Progressive strength in the ego identity, for example, can be charted in terms of a series of stages in which identity is formed in response to increasingly sophisticated challenges. The process of forming a viable sense of identity for the culture is conceptualized as an adolescent task, and those who do not manage a resynthesis of childhood identifications are seen as being in a state of 'identity diffusion' whereas those who retain their initially given identities unquestioned have 'foreclosed' identities (Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 p7-8). On some readings of Erikson, the development of a strong ego identity, along with the proper integration into a stable society and culture, lead to a stronger sense of identity in general. Accordingly, a deficiency in either of these factors may increase the chance of an identity crisis or confusion (Cote & Levine 2002, p. 22)."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What concept helps map and define people's experiences of self in society?", "id": "5709847a200fba1400368111", "answers": [{"text": "the concept of boundaries", "answer_start": 49}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is a volatile, flexible, and abstract thing?", "id": "5709847a200fba1400368112", "answers": [{"text": "identity", "answer_start": 218}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Language, dress, behavior, and choice of space are affected by recognition by what group?", "id": "5709847a200fba1400368113", "answers": [{"text": "other social beings", "answer_start": 507}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do markers help create?", "id": "5709847a200fba1400368114", "answers": [{"text": "boundaries", "answer_start": 555}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Markers can be used to exert what on other people?", "id": "5709847a200fba1400368115", "answers": [{"text": "influence", "answer_start": 908}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "self in society", "answer_start": 195}], "question": "What concept helps people define boundaries of people's experiences?", "id": "5a14a3c2a54d4200185292cf", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the use of markers such as language, dress, behaviour and choice of space,", "answer_start": 387}], "question": "What things make identity less evident?", "id": "5a14a3c2a54d4200185292d0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "other social beings", "answer_start": 507}], "question": "Whose recognition is identity depended on", "id": "5a14a3c2a54d4200185292d1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Markers", "answer_start": 528}], "question": "What do boundaries help create?", "id": "5a14a3c2a54d4200185292d2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "misunderstandings", "answer_start": 752}], "question": "What can cause misinterpretations of the significance of specific markers?", "id": "5a14a3c2a54d4200185292d3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "As a non-directive and flexible analytical tool, the concept of boundaries helps both to map and to define the changeability and mutability that are characteristic of people's experiences of the self in society.

Identity is made evident through the use of markers such as language, dress, behaviour and choice of space, whose effect depends on their recognition by other social beings. Markers help to create the boundaries that define similarities or differences between the marker wearer and the marker perceivers, their effectiveness depends on a shared understanding of their meaning. In a social context, misunderstandings can arise due to a misinterpretation of the significance of specific markers.

Hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of the world population growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth. The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity.

Joseph F. Smith, LDS Church president, settled the question for a time by asking that evolution not be taught at the school.

In response to segregation, disfranchisement and agricultural depression, many African Americans migrated from Florida to northern cities in the Great Migration, in waves from 1910 to 1940, and again starting in the later 1940s. They moved for jobs, better education for their children and the chance to vote and participate in society. By 1960 the proportion of African Americans in the state had declined to 18%. Conversely large numbers of northern whites moved to the state.[citation needed] Today, large concentrations of black residents can be found in northern and central Florida.

Although other bands, including the Beatles, had made short promotional films or videos of songs prior to this, generally, those were specifically made to be aired on specific television shows.

However, both Pereskia and Echinocactus have spines produced from areoles (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related."}], "title": "Botany"}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who did Madonna turn to for comfort during her mother's illness?", "id": "572668e2708984140094c517", "answers": [{"text": "paternal grandmother", "answer_start": 22}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How did the Ciccone siblings behaved towards anyone brought to their home to replace their beloved mother?", "id": "572668e2708984140094c518", "answers": [{"text": "rebelled", "answer_start": 113}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did Madonna tell in an interview that as a young girl, she was lonely and always searching for something?", "id": "572668e2708984140094c519", "answers": [{"text": "Vanity Fair", "answer_start": 234}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Afraid that Tony would be taken from her, what does she do?", "id": "572668e2708984140094c51a", "answers": [{"text": "unable to sleep unless she was near him", "answer_start": 632}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Madonna turned to her paternal grandmother for solace.

By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as arsenic, mercury, and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, pyrethrum, which is derived from chrysanthemums, and rotenone, which is derived from the roots of tropical vegetables. Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant. Paul M\u00fcller discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide.

The states are made up of pairs of attributes (hot and moist, cold and moist, hot and dry, and cold and dry), which are made of four humours: blood, phlegm, green (or yellow) bile, and black bile (the bodily form of the elements).

They also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each protein molecule is composed of amino acids, which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. For all animals, some amino acids are essential (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are non-essential (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds). About twenty amino acids are found in the human body, and about ten of these are essential and, therefore, must be included in the diet. A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). A complete protein source contains all the essential amino acids; an incomplete protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What was the early recommended amount of water that was supposedly required to keep the body hydrated?", "id": "5726cfe5708984140094d213", "answers": [{"text": "6\u20138 glasses of water daily", "answer_start": 103}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who originally made a water intake recommendation in 1945?", "id": "5726cfe5708984140094d214", "answers": [{"text": "Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council", "answer_start": 360}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How much water should be taken in for each calorie of food that is consumed?", "id": "5726cfe5708984140094d215", "answers": [{"text": "1 milliliter", "answer_start": 469}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does ADI stand for?", "id": "5726cfe5708984140094d216", "answers": [{"text": "adequate daily intakes", "answer_start": 972}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where do humans get the 20% of water that does not come from the beverages we drink?", "id": "5726cfe5708984140094d217", "answers": [{"text": "food", "answer_start": 1565}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Early recommendations for the quantity of water required for maintenance of good health suggested that 6\u20138 glasses of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration.

The original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council read: \"An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods.\" More recent comparisons of well-known recommendations on fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies in the volumes of water we need to consume for good health. Therefore, to help standardize guidelines, recommendations for water consumption are included in two recent European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) documents (2010): (i) Food-based dietary guidelines and (ii) Dietary reference values for water or adequate daily intakes (ADI). These specifications were provided by calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of individuals with \u201cdesirable osmolarity values of urine and desirable water volumes per energy unit consumed.\u201d For healthful hydration, the current EFSA guidelines recommend total water intakes of 2.0 L/day for adult females and 2.5 L/day for adult males. These reference values include water from drinking water, other beverages, and from food. About 80% of our daily water requirement comes from the beverages we drink, with the remaining 20% coming from food. Water content varies depending on the type of food consumed, with fruit and vegetables containing more than cereals, for example. These values are estimated using country-specific food balance sheets published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. Other guidelines for nutrition also have implications for the beverages we consume for healthy hydration- for example, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that added sugars should represent no more than 10% of total energy intake."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What percentage of people were were found to have a high likelihood of low literacy skills in the Mississippi Delta region?", "id": "57270b64708984140094d901", "answers": [{"text": "52", "answer_start": 120}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What primary difference was there between the NAAL and Delta study that made comparisons difficult?", "id": "57270b64708984140094d902", "answers": [{"text": "methodological differences", "answer_start": 294}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who was the main author of the study that suggested that the Mississippi Delta study identified a problem of health literacy?", "id": "57270b64708984140094d903", "answers": [{"text": "Zoellner", "answer_start": 322}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "For how many years had the My Pyramid graphic been released at the time of the Mississippi Delta study?", "id": "57270b64708984140094d904", "answers": [{"text": "two", "answer_start": 644}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Income level was found to have a signification correlation to which outcome in the study?", "id": "57270b64708984140094d905", "answers": [{"text": "nutrition literacy", "answer_start": 749}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Another study examining the health and nutrition literacy status of residents of the lower Mississippi Delta found that 52 percent of participants had a high likelihood of limited literacy skills.

While the Wagner Act protected workers and unions it did not protect minorities, who, exempting the Congress of Industrial Organizations, were often barred from union ranks.:11 This original coining of the term therefore has little to do with affirmative action policy as it is seen today, but helped set the stage for all policy meant to compensate or address an individual's unjust treatment.[citation needed]"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which piece of legislation quickly followed President Kennedy's assassination?", "id": "5727364f708984140094daf3", "answers": [{"text": "Civil Rights Act", "answer_start": 29}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Outside of the private business regulations, what was the other aim of the Civil Rights Act?", "id": "5727364f708984140094daf4", "answers": [{"text": "integrate public facilities", "answer_start": 234}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which other Executive Order did the Civil Right's Act work closely with?", "id": "5727364f708984140094daf5", "answers": [{"text": "11114", "answer_start": 515}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the purpose of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act?", "id": "5727364f708984140094daf6", "answers": [{"text": "to end discrimination in all firms with 25 or more employees", "answer_start": 753}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the goal of the Equal Employment Opportunity C omission?", "id": "5727364f708984140094daf7", "answers": [{"text": "ending discrimination in the nation's workplace", "answer_start": 916}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Civil Rights Act", "answer_start": 29}], "question": "Which piece of legislation quickly followed Vice-President Kennedy's assassination?", "id": "5ad41292604f3c001a400249", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "integrate public facilities", "answer_start": 234}], "question": "Outside of the private business regulations, what was the other aim of the Non-Civil Rights Act?", "id": "5ad41292604f3c001a40024a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "11114", "answer_start": 515}], "question": "Which other Executive Order did the Civil Right's Act not work closely with?", "id": "5ad41292604f3c001a40024b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "end discrimination", "answer_start": 756}], "question": " What was the purpose of Title VII of the Non-Civil Rights Act?", "id": "5ad41292604f3c001a40024c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "This eventually led to LBJ's Civil Rights Act, which came shortly after President Kennedy's assassination.

The Jardin des deux Rives, spread over Strasbourg and Kehl on both sides of the Rhine opened in 2004 and is the most extended (60-hectare) park of the agglomeration. The most recent park is Parc du Heyritz (8,7 ha), opened in 2014 along a canal facing the h\u00f4pital civil."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What are incunabula's?

Norman Daniel points out that the Arab equivalent of the Latin disputation, the taliqa, was reserved for the ruler's court, not the madrasa, and that the actual differences between Islamic fiqh and medieval European civil law were profound. The taliqa only reached Islamic Spain, the only likely point of transmission, after the establishment of the first medieval universities. In fact, there is no Latin translation of the taliqa and, most importantly, no evidence of Latin scholars ever showing awareness of Arab influence on the Latin method of disputation, something they would have certainly found noteworthy. Rather, it was the medieval reception of the Greek Organon which set the scholastic sic et non in motion. Daniel concludes that resemblances in method had more to with the two religions having \"common problems: to reconcile the conflicting statements of their own authorities, and to safeguard the data of revelation from the impact of Greek philosophy\"; thus Christian scholasticism and similar Arab concepts should be viewed in terms of a parallel occurrence, not of the transmission of ideas from one to the other, a view shared by Hugh Kennedy."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What percentage of Islamic women were educated before the 1200s?", "id": "572a7f2034ae481900deab4d", "answers": [{"text": "less than one percent", "answer_start": 47}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many female Islamic scholars were on record after the 1400s?", "id": "572a7f2034ae481900deab4e", "answers": [{"text": "over 8,000", "answer_start": 176}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what book was a section reserved for the study of Islamic female students?", "id": "572a7f2034ae481900deab4f", "answers": [{"text": "al-\u1e0caw\u02be al-l\u0101mi\u02bb", "answer_start": 304}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many female students were discussed in the al-Daw' al-Iami?", "id": "572a7f2034ae481900deab50", "answers": [{"text": "1,075", "answer_start": 363}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "less than one percent", "answer_start": 47}], "question": "What percentage of Islamic women were educated before the 2000s?", "id": "5ace800732bba1001ae4a871", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "over 8,000", "answer_start": 176}], "question": " How many female Islamic scholars were on record after the 1600s?", "id": "5ace800732bba1001ae4a872", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "al-\u1e0caw\u02be al-l\u0101mi\u02bb", "answer_start": 304}], "question": "In what book was a section reserved for the study of Islamic male students?", "id": "5ace800732bba1001ae4a873", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1,075", "answer_start": 363}], "question": " How many male students were discussed in the al-Daw' al-Iami?", "id": "5ace800732bba1001ae4a874", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Prior to the 12th century, women accounted for less than one percent of the world\u2019s Islamic scholars.

Designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organisation, like \"can a customer also be a supplier?\", or \"if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging, are those the same product or different products?\", or \"if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt, is that one flight or two (or maybe even three)?\".

In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England, and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and British, whilst the common people were largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial Battle of Aughrim in Ireland. Resistance held out, and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the Treaty of Limerick. However, in the evolving political climate, the terms of Limerick were superseded, a new monarchy was installed, and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws, which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which state send members to the parliament in Edinburgh?", "id": "5730360004bcaa1900d77375", "answers": [{"text": "Scotland", "answer_start": 236}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of government does the United Kingdom and the Crown Dependencies have?", "id": "5730360004bcaa1900d77376", "answers": [{"text": "parliamentary democracies", "answer_start": 69}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who shares power in Northern Ireland?", "id": "5730360004bcaa1900d77377", "answers": [{"text": "unionists and nationalists", "answer_start": 481}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Unionists in Northern Ireland want to remain part of which country?", "id": "5730360004bcaa1900d77378", "answers": [{"text": "United Kingdom", "answer_start": 763}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Nationalist in Northern Ireland want to join which country?", "id": "5730360004bcaa1900d77379", "answers": [{"text": "the rest of Ireland", "answer_start": 841}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "their own separate parliaments", "answer_start": 101}], "question": "Ireland, the UK and the 3 Crown Dependencies are socialistic democracies with what?

Concerns were raised that secure boot could prevent or hinder the use of alternate operating systems such as Linux. In a post discussing secure boot on the Building Windows 8 blog, Microsoft developer Tony Mangefeste indicated that vendors would provide means to customize secure boot, stating that \"At the end of the day, the customer is in control of their PC. Microsoft's philosophy is to provide customers with the best experience first, and allow them to make decisions themselves.\" Microsoft's certification guidelines for Windows 8 ultimately revealed that vendors would be required to provide means for users to re-configure or disable secure boot in their device's UEFI firmware. It also revealed that ARM devices (Windows RT) would be required to have secure boot permanently enabled, with no way for users to disable it. However, Tom Warren of The Verge noted that other vendors have implemented similar hardware restrictions on their own ARM-based tablet and smartphone products (including those running Microsoft's own Windows Phone platform), but still argued that Microsoft should \"keep a consistent approach across ARM and x86, though, not least because of the number of users who'd love to run Android alongside Windows 8 on their future tablets.\" No mandate is made regarding the installation of third-party certificates that would enable running alternative programs."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What percent of tablets were running Windows in Q1 2013/", "id": "57305291069b531400832053", "answers": [{"text": "7.4", "answer_start": 372}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was Androids market share in 2013?", "id": "57305291069b531400832054", "answers": [{"text": "43.4%", "answer_start": 548}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was teh iOS market share in 2013?", "id": "57305291069b531400832055", "answers": [{"text": "48.2%", "answer_start": 558}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does Strategy Analytics say Windows tablets are lacking?", "id": "57305291069b531400832056", "answers": [{"text": "top tier apps", "answer_start": 720}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did Windows 8 surpass Windows Vistas market share?", "id": "57305291069b531400832057", "answers": [{"text": "July 2013", "answer_start": 104}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "7.4%", "answer_start": 372}], "question": "What percent of tablets were running Windows in Q1 2012?", "id": "5ad4a0cbba00c4001a268e56", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "43.4%", "answer_start": 548}], "question": "What was Androids market share in 2012?", "id": "5ad4a0cbba00c4001a268e57", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "48.2%", "answer_start": 558}], "question": "What was the iOS market share in 2012?", "id": "5ad4a0cbba00c4001a268e58", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "top tier apps", "answer_start": 720}], "question": "What doesn't Strategy Analytics say Windows tablets are lacking?", "id": "5ad4a0cbba00c4001a268e59", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "July 2013", "answer_start": 104}], "question": "When did Windows 9 surpass Windows Vistas market share?", "id": "5ad4a0cbba00c4001a268e5a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Windows 8 surpassed Windows Vista in market share with a 5.1% usage rate according to numbers posted in July 2013 by Net Applications, with usage on a steady upward trajectory.

This literature facilitated the conversion to Christianity of the Eastern Slavs and introduced them to rudimentary Greek philosophy, science, and historiography without the necessity of learning Greek (there were some merchants who did business with Greeks and likely had an understanding of contemporary business Greek). In contrast, educated people in medieval Western and Central Europe learned Latin. Enjoying independence from the Roman authority and free from tenets of Latin learning, the East Slavs developed their own literature and fine arts, quite distinct from those of other Eastern Orthodox countries.[citation needed] (See Old East Slavic language and Architecture of Kievan Rus for details ).

In 1439, while employed in Naples at the court of Alfonso V of Aragon (at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States) the humanist Lorenzo Valla used stylistic textual analysis, now called philology, to prove that the Donation of Constantine, which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome, was an 8th-century forgery. For the next 70 years, however, neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way. Instead, after the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Turks in 1453, which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy, humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism, hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches, and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world.

Atherosclerosis is the gradual buildup of cholesterol and fibrous tissue in plaques in the wall of arteries (in this case, the coronary arteries), typically over decades. Bloodstream column irregularities visible on angiography reflect artery lumen narrowing as a result of decades of advancing atherosclerosis. Plaques can become unstable, rupture, and additionally promote the formation of a blood clot that occludes the artery; this can occur in minutes. When a severe enough plaque rupture occurs in the coronary arteries, it leads to MI (necrosis of downstream myocardium). It is estimated that one billion cardiac cells are lost in a typical MI."}], "title": "Myocardial_infarction"}]}
